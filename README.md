This is an Activator template for quickly starting a new project that uses
LWJGL and Scala. This project "seed" should start you off with the bare minimum
of what you'd need to develop a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac) game with
Scala.

Included is an example of how one might go about converting functions into
various "Callbacks" for more streamlined integration with GLFW.

Have fun.
